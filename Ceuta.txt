Ceuta (UK: /ˈsjuːtə/, US: /ˈseɪuːtə/ [5][6], Spanish: [ˈsewta, ˈθewta] ⓘ; Tarifit: ⵙⴰⴱⵜⴰ, romanized: Sabta; Arabic: سَبْتَة, romanized: Sabtah) is an autonomous city of Spain on the North African coast.

Bordered by Morocco, it lies along the boundary between the Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean. Ceuta is one of the special member state territories of the European Union, and it is one of several Spanish territories in Africa, which include Melilla and the Canary Islands. It was a regular municipality belonging to the province of Cádiz prior to the passing of its Statute of Autonomy in March 1995,[7] as provided by the Spanish Constitution, henceforth becoming an autonomous city.
